# What is a selector?

A **_CSS_** selector is the first part of a **_CSS_** Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which **_HTML_** elements should be selected to have the **_CSS_** property values inside the rule applied to them. The element or elements which are selected by the selector are referred to as the subject of the selector.

In other articles you may have met some different selectors, and learned that there are selectors that target the document in different ways â€” for example by selecting an element such as `h1`, or a class such as `.special`.

In **_CSS_**, selectors are defined in the **_CSS_** Selectors specification; like any other part of **_CSS_** they need to have support in browsers for them to work. The majority of selectors that you will come across are defined in [Level 3 Selectors specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/)  and [Level 4 Selectors specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/) , which are both mature specifications, therefore you will find excellent browser support for these selectors.

## Selector lists

If you have more than one thing which uses the same **_CSS_** then the individual selectors can be combined into a selector list so that the rule is applied to all of the individual selectors. For example, if I have the same **_CSS_** for an`h1`and also a class of `.special`, I could write this as two separate rules.

**_CSS_**

```javascript
h1 {
  color: blue;
}

.special {
  color: blue;
}
```

I could also combine these into a selector list, by adding a comma between them.

**_CSS_**

```javascript
h1, .special {
  color: blue;
}
```

White space is valid before or after the comma. You may also find the selectors more readable if each is on a new line.

**_CSS_**

```javascript
h1,
.special {
  color: blue;
}
```

## Summary

In this article we've introduced **_CSS_** selectors, which enable you to target particular **_HTML_** elements. Next, we'll take a closer look at [type, class, and ID selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors/Type_Class_and_ID_Selectors) .
